A pipe game inspired by a childhood favorite, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania
I am building this using as few libraries as I can get away with.

Currently, only uses python standard library plus keyboard.

Controls:
  - space - rotate pipe
  - esc - quit
  - r - restart
  - x - advance time by one tick
